# Password Reset API Documentation

## Overview

The BloomTrack POS system provides a secure password reset workflow using email-based OTP (One-Time Password) verification. This API uses Nodemailer for email delivery and includes robust security features.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Request Password Reset - Send OTP

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/send-otp`

```json
{
  "success": true,

  "expiresIn": "10 minutes"
}
```

**Error Responses:**

## Frontend Integration

Your React frontend should implement this flow:

1. **Forgot Password Page**: Collect email, call `/send-otp`
2. **OTP Verification Page**: Collect OTP, call `/verify-otp`
3. **New Password Page**: Collect new password, call `/reset-password`

---

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_16_character_app_password

# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pos_db
```

### Gmail Setup

1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Google Account Settings â†’ Security
   - Select "App passwords"
   - Choose "Mail" and generate password
3. Use the 16-character app password (not your regular Gmail password)

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing Flow

1. **Send OTP**: Use a valid registered email
2. **Check Email**: Verify OTP is received (check spam folder)
3. **Verify OTP**: Use the 6-digit code from email
4. **Reset Password**: Provide a strong new password

### Test Script

Run the included test script to verify database connectivity:

```bash
node test_otp.js
```

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints return consistent error format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Descriptive error message"
}
```

Common error scenarios:
- Network connectivity issues
- Database connection problems
- Email service authentication failures
- Invalid input data
- Expired or invalid OTPs

---

## Production Considerations

1. **Remove Debug Logging**: Remove OTP console.log statements
2. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all API calls use secure connections
3. **Monitor Email Quotas**: Track Gmail API usage
4. **Database Backup**: Regular backups of user data
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider additional rate limiting middleware
6. **Email Templates**: Customize templates with your branding
